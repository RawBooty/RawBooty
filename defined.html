        <h2>RawBooty (n.)</h2>
        <p><strong>RawBooty</strong>: unrefined treasure or spoils of war, conquest, or competitive acquisition, presented in its most direct, untampered state.</p>
        <p>RawBooty is a domain-specific instantiation of the primitive “booty,” constrained to its unrefined state. It does not introduce a new meaning class; it inherits and specifies the classical primitive.</p>

    <h2>Mission</h2>
   <div class="mission">
    <p>Our mission with this site is specific. With decades of research on these subjects behind us, we aim to provide a clear, accurate, foundational framework for the core technologies and mechanisms that underpin human society. We do this without proselytizing or teleological bias. Our lens is calibrated, as best as possible, for Darwinian capitalism — not moral, social, or ideological framing.</p>
  <p>Why: We believe that to truly understand the world, you must first strip away all value judgment. How you choose to use this knowledge is where ethics, morals, and other philosophical considerations can (and should) be introduced. Evaluating those applications, however, is beyond the scope of our mission.</p>

    <h1>Etymology</h1>
      <section id="raw">
        <h2>Raw</h2>
        <p>The term <strong>raw</strong> denotes unprocessed, unrefined, or unaltered. In the context of RawBooty, it emphasizes that the captured value remains in its most direct, untampered form, prior to refinement, allocation, or transformation. Historically, “raw” has been used in both material and metaphorical contexts to describe items, goods, or experiences in their natural, initial, or undistilled state.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="booty">
        <h2>Booty</h2>
        <p><strong>Booty</strong> is defined as valuables seized through conflict, strategy, or superior positioning. Mid-15th century English <em>bottyne</em>, from Old French <em>butin</em> (“plunder, gain”), from Middle Low German <em>būte</em> (“exchange, distribution of spoils”).</p>
        
        <p>Historical usage encompasses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>War spoils, captured under formal or sanctioned conflict.</li>
          <li>Pirate hoards and maritime prizes.</li>
          <li>Gains extracted from risk-laden economic or competitive environments.</li>
        </ul>
    
      <p>As a primitive, <strong>booty</strong> is contextually inert; its meaning is activated only when paired with a domain such as war, maritime law, or competitive extraction.</p>
       <p>This meaning was eventually codified in law as part of maritime and prize law, establishing a formal and legally recognized definition for the term.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="convergence">
        <h2>Convergence and Stabilization</h2>
        <p>The term <strong>booty</strong> represents an organic lexical convergence across multiple linguistic sources. Its classical, historical, and legal meanings form the anchor from which derivative interpretations may drift. Temporal and cultural propagation has allowed the term to evolve, but the classical meaning remains authoritative.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="disambiguation">
        <h2>Disambiguation / Excluded Meaning Classes</h2>
        <p>The modern slang interpretation of <strong>booty</strong>—typically sexualized, colloquial, or metaphorical—is explicitly excluded by this document. These uses are treated as non-applicable derivative projections and do not inform the canonical or vectorized definition of the primitive.</p>
      </section>
      
      <hr>
      <section id="hierarchy">
        <h2>Hierarchy of Meaning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Level 0 (Primitive):</strong> Booty — movable value captured under risk and acquisition constraints</li>
          <li><strong>Level 1 (Institutions):</strong> War law, maritime prize law, economic extraction</li>
          <li><strong>Level 2 (Derivatives):</strong> Slang or metaphorical uses (excluded here)</li>
          <li><strong>Level 3 (Brand Object):</strong> RawBooty — primitive instance in a raw, unrefined state</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="vector">
        <h2>Vector Definition</h2>
        <p>
          Let <code>B ∈ ℝⁿ</code> denote the semantic state of <strong>booty</strong>.  
          <code>P = {v, r, a, u}</code> represents primitive dimensions: value (<em>v</em>), risk (<em>r</em>), acquisition (<em>a</em>), and uncertainty (<em>u</em>).  
          Then:
          <br>
          <code>B = Σᵢ wᵢ · Pᵢ</code>, where <code>wᵢ ≥ 0</code> and <code>Σᵢ wᵢ = 1</code>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Semantic Domain:</strong> The space <code>ℝⁿ</code> belongs to the domain of <em>captured value under risk and acquisition constraints</em>, excluding metaphorical, slang, or sexualized corpora.</p>
        <p>Note: Semantic drift occurs when <code>∂wᵢ / ∂t → 0</code> for risk and acquisition.</p>
