        <h2>RawBooty (n.)</h2>
        <p><strong>RawBooty</strong>: unrefined treasure or spoils of war, conquest, or competitive acquisition, presented in its most direct, untampered state.</p>
<p>RawBooty is a domain-specific instantiation of the primitive “booty,” constrained to its unrefined state. It does not introduce a new meaning class; it inherits and specifies the classical primitive.</p>

      <!-- Raw Section -->
      <section id="raw">
        <h2>Raw</h2>
        <p>The term <strong>raw</strong> denotes unprocessed, unrefined, or unaltered. In the context of RawBooty, it emphasizes that the captured value remains in its most direct, untampered form, prior to refinement, allocation, or transformation. Historically, “raw” has been used in both material and metaphorical contexts to describe items, goods, or experiences in their natural, initial, or undistilled state.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Booty Section -->
      <section id="booty">
        <h2>Booty</h2>
        <p><strong>Booty</strong> is defined as valuables seized through conflict, strategy, or superior positioning. Mid-15th century English <em>bottyne</em>, from Old French <em>butin</em> (“plunder, gain”), from Middle Low German <em>būte</em> (“exchange, distribution of spoils”).</p>
        
        <p>Historical usage encompasses:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>War spoils, captured under formal or sanctioned conflict.</li>
          <li>Pirate hoards and maritime prizes.</li>
          <li>Gains extracted from risk-laden economic or competitive environments.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>As a primitive, <strong>booty</strong> is contextually inert; its meaning is activated only when paired with a domain such as war, maritime law, or competitive extraction.</p>


        <p>This meaning was eventually codified in law as part of maritime and prize law, establishing a formal and legally recognized definition for the term.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Convergence and Stabilization -->
      <section id="convergence">
        <h2>Convergence and Stabilization</h2>
        <p>The term <strong>booty</strong> represents an organic lexical convergence across multiple linguistic sources. Its classical, historical, and legal meanings form the anchor from which derivative interpretations may drift. Temporal and cultural propagation has allowed the term to evolve, but the classical meaning remains authoritative.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Disambiguation Section -->
      <section id="disambiguation">
        <h2>Disambiguation / Excluded Meaning Classes</h2>
        <p>The modern slang interpretation of <strong>booty</strong>—typically sexualized, colloquial, or metaphorical—is explicitly excluded by this document. These uses are treated as non-applicable derivative projections and do not inform the canonical or vectorized definition of the primitive.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Hierarchy of Meaning -->
      <section id="hierarchy">
        <h2>Hierarchy of Meaning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Level 0 (Primitive):</strong> Booty — movable value captured under risk and acquisition constraints</li>
          <li><strong>Level 1 (Institutions):</strong> War law, maritime prize law, economic extraction</li>
          <li><strong>Level 2 (Derivatives):</strong> Slang or metaphorical uses (excluded here)</li>
          <li><strong>Level 3 (Brand Object):</strong> RawBooty — primitive instance in a raw, unrefined state</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- Vector / Semantic Object -->
      <section id="vector">
        <h2>Vector Definition</h2>
        <p>
          Let <code>B ∈ ℝⁿ</code> denote the semantic state of <strong>booty</strong>.  
          <code>P = {v, r, a, u}</code> represents primitive dimensions: value (<em>v</em>), risk (<em>r</em>), acquisition (<em>a</em>), and uncertainty (<em>u</em>).  
          Then:
          <br>
          <code>B = Σᵢ wᵢ · Pᵢ</code>, where <code>wᵢ ≥ 0</code> and <code>Σᵢ wᵢ = 1</code>.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Semantic Domain:</strong> The space <code>ℝⁿ</code> belongs to the domain of <em>captured value under risk and acquisition constraints</em>, excluding metaphorical, slang, or sexualized corpora.</p>
        <p>Note: Semantic drift occurs when <code>∂wᵢ / ∂t → 0</code> for risk and acquisition.</p>
