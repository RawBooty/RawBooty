  <p><strong>The Birth of Multiverse Reflexivity</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Why Bubbles Last Longer (But Still Burst)</strong></p>
  <p>Over roughly the last ~decade, the markets have become increasingly
  unsettling.</p>
  <p>The cycles I studied, trained on, and experienced professionally no
  longer behave the way they used to. Yes, bubbles still form, but they
  no longer end cleanly. Instead of rising, peaking, and collapsing,
  they now partially deflate, re-inflate, persisting far longer than
  expected, or worse yet bleeding into adjacent narratives seeding
  smaller secondary bubbles. What looks like a terminal phase often
  turns out to be an intermission. What used to be a single clean
  bubble, looks increasing like a bubble cluster.</p>
  <p>This phenomenon can be observed everywhere: crypto $btc, electric
  vehicles $tsla, AI $NVDA, precious metals $SLV $GLD, space $ASTS.
  Valuations that once would have been all but impossible, now not only
  exist, but seem to persist for years. Even when faced with
  deteriorating fundamentals, prices drift inexorably higher. As for the
  corrections, if you want to call them that, when they do arrive, they
  are often sharp, shallow and short-lived. *Something* keeps
  re-animating the cycle.</p>
  <p>The obvious explanation is “inflation” but this explanation is
  woefully incomplete. Yes inflation may explain nominal price drift,
  but it does not explain duration, resilience, or repeated renewal.
  Something structural has changed.</p>
  <p>What follows is my attempt to explain what that change is.</p>
  <p>(⟨M | U⟩ = ∑ᵢ κᵢ · (τᵢ⁻¹ ⊕ αᵢ) ⊗ Lᵢ→ⱼ)</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Bubbles have always existed, our focus should be on their
  duration.</strong></p>
  <p>Before addressing what’s new, it helps to ground what is not.</p>
  <p>At the most basic level, a company is simply a legal structure that
  organizes people around a common purpose. For most of history,
  ownership of such structures was private: held by individuals or small
  partnerships. The creation of public equity markets was effectively a
  socialization (democratization) of ownership, allowing claims on
  future cash flows to be distributed widely across a large group of
  principals.</p>
  <p>For much of market history, the incentive to own equities was
  straightforward: pro-rata participation in cash flows via dividends.
  Over time, particularly following the introduction of capital gains
  taxation and changes in corporate governance, incentives shifted away
  from payout and toward reinvestment and price appreciation. Gradually,
  price came to dominate cash flow as the primary signal.</p>
  <p>Despite this evolution, one thing remained surprisingly stable: the
  <em>cycle</em>. Bubbles formed, inflated, and collapsed; typically
  over a horizon of three to five years. Excesses always corrected.
  Narratives exhausted themselves. Capital rotated.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Reflexivity in a Unified Market</strong></p>
  <p>Financial markets began as private transactions, then evolved into
  open outcry auctions in centralized physical locations. Later came
  telephones, electronic exchanges, and finally the internet. With each
  technological advance, information moved faster and transaction costs
  fell and access grew. But despite these changes, markets still
  functioned as a largely unified arena.</p>
  <p>Conceptually, it is useful to imagine the market as a single
  surface. Something like a shared plane of attention and price
  discovery.</p>
  <p>It was within this context that George Soros formally articulated
  the concept of <em>reflexivity</em>. The idea is simple: an external
  catalyst draws attention to a company or asset. Attention increases
  demand. Demand pushes price higher. Rising prices generate news. News
  draws further attention. The price action itself becomes a marketing
  mechanism.</p>
  <p>This feedback loop—news → attention → demand → price → more
  news—drives bubbles.</p>
  <p>In a unified market surface, this loop behaves like a wave moving
  across calm water. It expands until one of three things happens:
  momentum slows, attention saturates, or a cross-current disrupts the
  flow.</p>
  <p>When that happens, the loop breaks down, and the bubble
  collapses.</p>
  <p>Historically, this process produced relatively predictable
  lifespans.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Structural Break: Fragmentation of
  Attention</strong></p>
  <p>So why do cycles now appear to last a decade or more?</p>
  <p>The answer is both obvious and counterintuitive.</p>
  <p>The obvious part is that markets have fragmented. More precisely,
  the <em>surface</em> has fractured.</p>
  <p>The single most important catalyst for this fracture is the
  commoditization of the smartphone. Smartphones mobilized information,
  driving its marginal cost toward zero while making access omnipresent
  and real-time. Layered on top of this came zero-commission trading,
  fractional shares, and instant access to leverage through
  derivatives.</p>
  <p>Put simply the historical barriers to entry collapsed to near zero.
  Nearly everyone on planet earth can now, research and trade stocks and
  other financial instruments from their phone from anywhere on earth in
  real time.</p>
  <p>At the same time, market participation has shifted dramatically.
  Where markets were once dominated by slow-moving institutional capital
  (entities constrained by fiduciary duty, liquidity requirements, and
  career risk) they are now heavily influenced by retail participation.
  Retail traders act without fiduciary obligation, without liability,
  and without a requirement for diligence. Individually they are small
  and largely meaningless participants; collectively, their actions can
  overwhelm..</p>
  <p>Paradoxically, all this increase in access has caused liquidity to
  thin. Lot sizes shrank. Micro-transactions have proliferated and
  market depth has vanished.</p>
  <p>1980 average lot size was 500-2000 shares</p>
  <p>1990 average lot size was 500-1000</p>
  <p>2000 average lot size was 400-700 (post-decimalization)</p>
  <p>2010 average lot size was 200-400 (HFT, reg NMS, electronic
  fragmentation)</p>
  <p>2020 average lot size is 100-200 (zero commission, fractional
  shares, etc..)</p>
  <p>This converts markets from capital-weighted systems into
  attention-weighted ones. This alone meaningfully alters market
  dynamics; but it is not the core of the story.</p>
  <p>The deeper change came from social media.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Markets No Longer Share a Single Arena</strong></p>
  <p>To unpack this dynamic it’s important to understand that social
  media is not organized around finance. It is instead organized around
  interests, identity, and social networks. Additionally, financial
  information ultimately affects everyone, so it does not stay in its
  lane. When a signal is strong enough, financial news will radiate
  outwards, infecting adjacent communities that were never seeking it
  out.</p>
  <p>It’s also important to bear in mind that each major platform
  operates as its own universe of attention. For example: X behaves like
  a real-time stream of collective consciousness. TikTok is a
  high-velocity river of short-form video. Reddit is a slower collection
  of niche, self-reinforcing communities. YouTube is a vast, poorly
  navigated archive of long-form narratives. And there are many other
  large platforms.</p>
  <p>Importantly, each platform has its own culture, population, and
  algorithmic biases. Within each platform, users are further segmented
  into tightly quarantined silos. These silos behave like distinct
  attention surfaces, each with its own decay rate, amplification bias,
  and saturation threshold. They are akin to little self-contained
  microcosms, or universes.</p>
  <p>This self-isolation is practical. Creators, constrained by the
  labor intensity of quality production, typically operate on one or two
  platforms. As a result, crossovers are sparse. Intersections occur
  only when algorithms align or narratives mutate just enough to escape
  their original container.</p>
  <p>The result is not one market surface, but many. A fragmented map of
  attention composed of partially overlapping, desynchronized
  planes.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>When Reflexivity Went Trans-Surface</strong></p>
  <p>This is where classical reflexivity breaks down.</p>
  <p>The reflexive dynamics I learned early in my career assumed a
  unified surface. A single dominant feedback loop. A shared decay
  process.</p>
  <p>This assumption no longer works.</p>
  <p>Reflexive signals are no longer confined to one plane. They now
  propagate across multiple, misaligned attention surfaces. The best way
  I’ve found to visualize this is not as a wave, but as an amorphous
  mass floating through space.</p>
  <p>When a catalyst ignites reflexivity within one attention plane, it
  begins to accumulate momentum, pulling participants in through FOMO,
  transaction velocity, and narrative reinforcement. In a classical
  market, this mass would eventually lose coherence and collapse on
  saturation.</p>
  <p>In the current environment, something different happens.</p>
  <p>As the reflexive mass approaches saturation in one plane, it leaks
  into adjacent planes through cross-posting, algorithmic promotion, or
  narrative mutation. In transit, it deforms. It stretches, splits, and
  reconstitutes; less like a wave, more like a droplet in zero
  gravity.</p>
  <p>Momentum does not decay uniformly. It renews unevenly across
  segregated planes. What appears as exhaustion in one universe becomes
  ignition in another. The relevant variable is no longer local
  momentum, but something closer to a weighted, cross-plane gamma: an
  aggregate sensitivity to attention that is dynamic, path-dependent,
  and effectively unobservable in real time.</p>
  <p>Even after a cycle completes in a given plane, that same plane can
  be reseeded later with a variant of the old narrative, reviving
  curiosity among a new cohort. The mass does not die. It limps on,
  anchored elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Sharp pullbacks do still occur. These are often moments of
  decoupling. Local liquidity drains faster than attention can replenish
  it causing prices snap back. But the broader reflexive object
  stubbornly persists.</p>
  <p>The result is not a clean cycle, but a fractal descent that can
  linger for years.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Enabling Conditions</strong></p>
  <p>Several structural forces enable this regime.</p>
  <p>Liquidity thinning means prices are increasingly set by marginal
  trades rather than committed capital. Margin capacity is determined by
  the last trade, regardless of size. As lot sizes shrink, price becomes
  more detached from enterprise value.</p>
  <p>Narrative dominance has grown to largely replace fundamentals. For
  popular names, the investment is no longer in cash flows, but in
  attention. Stories with meme value are seemingly unconstrained.
  Capital requirements to push prices higher shrink as prices rise,
  creating a self-reinforcing loop.</p>
  <p>Institutions and algorithmic traders understand this dynamic. They
  do not fight it; they harvest it. Retail flow becomes both fuel and
  prey.</p>
  <p>Retail traders, once irrelevant, now behave like a swarm of
  locusts. Individually inconsequential, yet collectively overwhelming.
  They largely move without coordination, without liability, and without
  time horizons. In many ways they move without hesitation and their
  emotional responses, particularly FOMO, amplify reflexive dynamics far
  beyond historical precedent.</p>
  <p>What we have is an entirely new model of price discovery.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The New Timeline</strong></p>
  <p>The bottom line is this: we are operating on a new timeline.
  Historical analogs do not exist.</p>
  <p>Reflexivity itself has not changed. What has changed is the
  structure it propagates through.</p>
  <p>The classical formulation assumed a largely unified market surface:
  one dominant arena of attention, one primary feedback loop, one shared
  decay process. That definition is now too flat, too one dimensional.
  Attention is now fragmented across many parallel channels, each with
  its own dynamics and populations. Signal propagation across these
  channels, critically, is multiphasic.</p>
  <p>What we are experiencing behaves more like weather systems.</p>
  <p>No, bubbles are not new. What is new is their size, duration, and
  durability. They will still collapse, just under different conditions
  than we are accustomed to looking for.</p>
  <p>What is clear is that valuation no longer serves as a reliable
  signal. Social engagement (gamma) may matter more.</p>
  <p>For this reason, I find it useful to reframe reflexivity as
  something slightly different:</p>
  <p><strong>Multiverse Reflexivity</strong> (or reflexivityⁿ):<br />
  a regime in which feedback loops propagate across fragmented,
  desynchronized attention systems, extending duration and delaying
  saturation without eliminating collapse.</p>
  <p>This reframing does not make bubbles permanent. It simply makes
  them harder to time, more resilient to disruption, and more dangerous
  to dismiss.</p>
  <p>It also explains why, in this environment, being early increasingly
  feels indistinguishable from being wrong.</p>
