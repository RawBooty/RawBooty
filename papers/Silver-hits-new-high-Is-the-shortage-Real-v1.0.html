  <p><strong>Silver at $90: There Is No Silver Shortage</strong></p>
  <p>Silver has just crossed $90 an ounce for the first time in history.
  This is being framed variously as evidence of re-monetization,
  speculative mania, or an impending physical shortage. To understand
  what’s actually happening, we need to step away from narratives and
  look at the data.</p>
  <p>The short answer—uncomfortable as it may be—is that silver is not
  rare. In fact, for most of human history, it has existed in a state of
  persistent oversupply. “(USGS historical reconstructions place
  cumulative global silver mine production at roughly 55–60 billion
  ounces.)</p>
  <p>Meaningful industrial consumption of silver did not begin until the
  early 20th century. According to Silver Institute historical surveys,
  pre-1930 industrial usage was modest relative to mine supply,
  accelerating materially only with photography mid-century and
  electronics decades later.</p>
  <p>The obvious question is: <em>has modern industry consumed that
  silver?</em></p>
  <p>A simple mass-balance check answers this decisively.</p>

  <p><em>Figures rounded; intended to illustrate order-of-magnitude
  constraints based on Silver Institute, USGS, and industry historical
  averages rather than precise inventory accounting.</em></p>
  <p>Even under conservative assumptions, post-1930 industrial activity
  added tens of billions of ounces to above-ground silver inventories.
  The idea that modern industry has “used up” historical silver stocks
  does not survive even a cursory quantitative check.</p>
  <p>Silver has always been plentiful.</p>
  <p>This persistent abundance explains why there has historically been
  little incentive to develop primary silver mines. Hundreds of known
  deposits exist, but most remain undeveloped because silver was
  uneconomic below ~$20/oz. As a result, the majority of silver
  production today is recovered as a by-product of copper, lead, and
  zinc mining.</p>
  <p>Industry disclosures confirm this. All-in sustaining costs across
  major producers—Fresnillo, Pan American, Hecla—generally cluster in
  the <strong>$12–22/oz range</strong>, often lower once by-product
  credits are applied. Under normal conditions, prices at 4–5× marginal
  cost would attract overwhelming supply. Yet here we are. (Based on
  reported AISC figures from Fresnillo, Pan American Silver, and Hecla
  Mining filings, 2015–2024.)</p>
  <p>To understand why, we need to clarify a basic but rarely asked
  question:</p>
  <p>What does “silver at $90/oz” actually mean?</p>
  <p>It does <em>not</em> mean that the element silver is worth $90 per
  ounce.</p>
  <p>Just last week, I sold silver to a refiner where I hold an account.
  Standard marketable bars—1 oz, 5 oz, 10 oz, 100 oz—cleared at spot.
  But 20 oz bars? Paid at 85%. High-purity scrap? 85%. Sterling silver
  objects? Melt value at best.</p>
  <p>The metal was identical. The discount existed solely because those
  forms were not immediately marketable products. To the refiner, they
  required melting and refabrication into standardized units.</p>
  <p>The reference price used to determine payment was COMEX.</p>
  <p>And this is the critical point: COMEX is not a price for silver. It
  is a price for a specific product made out of silver.</p>
  <p>Under CME Rulebook Chapter 112, a COMEX silver futures contract
  represents 5,000 troy ounces, deliverable only as five ~1,000 oz bars
  (±10%), minimum 999 fineness, from approved refiners, held in approved
  warehouses.</p>
  <p>So the quoted $90/oz price is actually a price for 1/1000th of a
  COMEX-approved bar, in a specific location, under specific contractual
  conditions.</p>
  <p>The shortage, therefore, is not silver.</p>
  <p>It is a shortage of a <em>very specific fabricated
  product</em>.</p>
  <p>This distinction matters because deliverable inventory is tiny
  relative to paper claims:</p>

  <p><em>Open interest data from CFTC/CME; registered inventory from CME
  daily warehouse reports.</em></p>
  <p>These figures are not evidence of a silver shortage. They are
  evidence of product specificity.</p>
  <p>There is ample silver outside the COMEX system—in coins, bars,
  jewelry, scrap, and hoards—but only a narrow slice qualifies as
  deliverable inventory at any given moment.</p>
  <p>The market for elemental silver is diffuse and opaque. The market
  for silver futures is centralized, transparent, and small.</p>
  <p>Even at $90/oz, total annual mine supply represents roughly $80–90
  billion in market value—smaller than many single-company equities. Yet
  that entire market references a futures venue requiring only $6–7
  billion in margin capital. Initial margin requirements for COMEX
  silver futures typically range from roughly 8–12% of notional value,
  depending on volatility</p>
  <p>In effect, a few billion dollars of leveraged positioning
  establishes the reference price for nearly a trillion dollars’ worth
  of silver—not because the metal is scarce, but because price discovery
  is concentrated in a narrow financial instrument tied to a single
  deliverable product.</p>
  <p>Silver has always been mined and hoarded. Consumptive uses remained
  minimal until the 20th century, and even today industrial demand
  consumes well under half of annual mine supply. As a conductor, silver
  invites thrifting, substitution, and recovery—limiting sustained
  demand pressure. (Silver Institute data shows industrial demand
  typically accounting for ~45–50% of annual mine supply in recent
  years.)</p>
  <p>What <em>does</em> become scarce are COMEX-eligible bars.</p>
  <p>Fabricating 1,000 oz bars of high purity, certifying them, and
  delivering them to approved warehouses creates a real bottleneck.
  These facilities are capital-intensive, tightly regulated, and
  calibrated to normal demand—not speculative surges. Refiners have no
  incentive to maintain surplus capacity for moments like this.</p>
  <p>Because silver has been oversupplied for most of history, very
  little capital has flowed into new primary mine development. Known
  deposits remain undeveloped due to long lead times and the widely
  understood transience of high prices.</p>
  <p>Yes, $90 is a high-water mark. If you bought under $20 and sold
  here, you did extraordinarily well. But expecting prices like this to
  persist requires either sustained monetary inflation or a structural
  shift far larger than a COMEX bottleneck.</p>
  <p>From refiner flows alone, it’s clear metal is pouring back into the
  system, much of it destined for refabrication into deliverable bars.
  How long that process takes is uncertain—but capacity is expanding as
  fast as economics allow.</p>
  <p>As for central banks: they want nothing to do with silver.</p>
  <p>Bimetallism has been an expensive failure for over a millennium.
  Silver was formally demonetized in the late 19th century, after
  repeated attempts to maintain a gold-silver peg collapsed. At its
  peak, U.S. government silver stockpiles exceeded 3 billion ounces.
  “(U.S. Treasury historical records, mid-20th century.) Liquidating
  that position took decades and imposed a multi-generational ceiling on
  prices. Official selling began in the 1970s and ended in the early
  2000s.</p>
  <p>As for me? I sold my silver around $80, most of it purchased below
  $20. It’s fascinating to watch, but unless you’re holding
  COMEX-eligible bars in a COMEX warehouse, you’re trading derivatives
  of derivatives. How long liquidity holds—and at what price—is
  unknowable.</p>
  <p>One final note, to be expanded later: while U.S. debt levels are
  high and the dollar continues to lose purchasing power, the dollar
  standard is not in jeopardy. Not remotely. That claim can be
  demonstrated with data, and I will address it directly in future
  work.</p>
  <p>Good luck.<br />
