  <h2 id="investing-isnt-mysterious">Investing Isn’t Mysterious —</h2>
  <h2 id="its-a-personal-war-youre-fighting-with-yourself">It’s a
  Personal War You’re Fighting With Yourself</h2>
  <p>Investing has been mystified on purpose. The mystery employes a lot
  of otherwise useless people.</p>
  <p>The most popular and wrong-headed mystification is the Efficient
  Market Hypothesis, which—stripped of academic politeness—says this:
  outcomes are mostly luck, prices already reflect everything that
  matters, and no investor can have a durable edge.</p>
  <p>That story tests well in spreadsheets. It also feels like hot
  garbage to anyone who has actually lived inside markets.</p>
  <p>Here’s the reality: investing is not mysterious. In theory, it’s
  almost boring. You find people who are good at building value, and you
  give them money to do that work, you sit back, wait, and monitor their
  work.</p>
  <p>You can do this privately—buying businesses, real estate, lending
  capital—or publicly through stocks, bonds, and commodities.</p>
  <p>Things only get weird when you enter public markets.</p>
  <p>The public markets are weird because they drown you in “real time”
  information. Prices update constantly. News, earnings, forecasts,
  analyst notes, charts, indicators, momentum, narratives—an endless
  firehose. And here’s the uncomfortable truth:</p>
  <p>Most of this information is bullshit.</p>
  <p>Not because it’s fake—but because it pretends to answer a question
  that cannot be answered.</p>
  <h2 id="the-core-problem-you-cannot-value-a-company">The Core Problem:
  You Cannot Value a Company</h2>
  <p>It took me a lot time to accept this, and honestly I don’t care if
  you disagree. It’s the truth.</p>
  <p>There is no precise value for any company at any moment in
  time.</p>
  <p>Finance textbooks say a company is worth the net present value of
  its future cash flows. That sounds scientific until you realize it
  requires knowing the future. Future cash flows depend on management
  decisions, competition, regulation, technology, consumer behavior,
  macro shocks, and black swans. The inputs are infinite. The
  uncertainty is irreducible. To my knowledge – no-one can predict the
  future.</p>
  <p>No spreadsheet fixes this. No model escapes it.</p>
  <p>So, when you see a stock trading at $137.42, that number is not
  value. It is a temporary market clearing price, between opinions, for
  a tiny percentage of the equity in a company; not the whole
  company.</p>
  <p>This is why price is bullshit—not because it’s useless, but because
  it is radically overinterpreted. It has precision without truth.
  People confuse the number with knowledge.</p>
  <p>Technical analysis doesn’t escape this problem. Charts, patterns,
  indicators—they are not measuring reality either. They are measuring
  collective behavior reacting to a fictional proxy for value. That
  doesn’t make them magical. It makes them second-order psychology.</p>
  <h2 id="what-you-are-actually-doing-when-you-invest">What You Are
  Actually Doing When You Invest</h2>
  <p>Here’s the part almost everyone misses:</p>
  <p>You are not speculating in a company’s value.</p>
  <p>You are speculating in other people’s opinions about companies.</p>
  <p>Fundamentals matter—but only insofar as they influence beliefs.
  Your estimate of “intrinsic value” is not objective truth. It is your
  best guess about what <em>other people</em> will eventually believe,
  and when.</p>
  <p>This is the game.</p>
  <p>Markets are not discovery mechanisms for truth. They are
  coordination mechanisms for belief under uncertainty. Price is the
  current consensus snapshot. Investing is betting that consensus will
  change in your favor over time.</p>
  <p>Once you see this, a lot of fake arguments disappear.</p>
  <p>The Efficient Market Hypothesis works in large samples because
  averages tend to converge toward averages. But opportunity does not
  live in averages. It lives in tails—where beliefs diverge, emotions
  spike, and expectations break. Outsized opportunity is scarce and
  momentary.</p>
  <p>Fortune favors the prepared and the patient.</p>
  <p>At the end of the day, generating alpha comes from dislocations
  between perception and future perception.</p>
  <h2 id="the-personal-battle-no-one-escapes">The Personal Battle No One
  Escapes</h2>
  <p>This is where investing stops being academic and becomes
  personal.</p>
  <p>The hardest part of investing is not analysis—it’s you.</p>
  <p>The moment you commit capital, fear and greed enter the room. Your
  nervous system lights up. Stress distorts judgment. This, turns
  investing into a psychological endurance test.</p>
  <p>To survive, you have to know yourself better than most people ever
  will know themselves. You must learn to gain a 3<sup>rd</sup> person
  perspective of yourself, and study yourself like the poor tortured lab
  rat you are. Take notes.</p>
  <p>Learn:</p>
  <p>How much volatility can you tolerate?<br />
  How long can you be wrong before you break?<br />
  Do you experience stress acutely or chronically?<br />
  Do you seek stimulation or avoid it?</p>
  <p>Strategy must fit personality.</p>
  <p>If spending money feels painful and saving feels natural, you are
  likely oriented toward value investing, or GARP. If spending is easy
  and risk excites you, you may lean toward trading or speculation. If
  you are highly social, you may read sentiment well. If you are
  solitary, you may excel at slow, fundamental work.</p>
  <p>These are tendencies, not rules. Knowing them does not guarantee
  success—but ignoring them guarantees failure.</p>
  <p>The best advice I ever received came from a famous fund-of-funds
  manager who early in my career told me, <em>“investing is like buying
  a suit of clothes. You must buy what fits your personality otherwise
  you will always be self-conscious and feel foolish.”</em></p>
  <p>That sentence took me decades to fully understand.</p>
  <h2 id="using-yourself-as-an-instrument">Using Yourself as an
  Instrument</h2>
  <p>One of the most important lessons you can learn is that your
  emotions are not enemies. They are data.</p>
  <p>Fear, greed, boredom, apathy—these are signals. If you learn to
  observe them without obeying them, they become tools. You begin to
  understand how others feel by understanding yourself first.</p>
  <p>All action, however, must come from the rational mind. Emotion
  informs. Reason decides.</p>
  <p>Do this well and you will outperform most participants—not because
  you are smarter, but because most people are fighting themselves
  without knowing it.</p>
  <h2 id="what-these-papers-are-and-arent">What These Papers Are (And
  Aren’t)</h2>
  <p>The papers on this site are not about stock tips or specific
  strategies. They are about orientation. All of them in every category
  are intended to teach you fundamental lessons about the world. Each is
  a tool you may find useful later in life.</p>
  <p>For a time, my job was studying how hedge fund managers made money.
  I worked at a hedge fund that invested in other funds. I’ve also
  managed a hedge fund, and real estate, and a whole lot of other
  stuff... this experience doesn’t make me any better than anyone else.
  All it did was to a different perspective. I am probably wrong about
  most things, that’s how life tends to work. That said, buried in here
  I’m confident you’ll find more value than you will other places. Why?
  Because I am going to tell you what no-one was ever willing to tell me
  without apply filters or bias.</p>
  <p>These opinions are being presented in their raw form. Why? Because
  I can. And because I want to. If this makes you un-happy go somewhere
  else.</p>
  <p>I say this simply because what I’ve discovered over the course of
  my career is that most investing advice, hell most advice, is
  prescriptive: buy this, follow that rule.</p>
  <p>I want to do something entirely different. I want to teach you
  self-diagnosis.</p>
  <p>Any strategy that looks perfect on paper but doesn’t fit you will
  almost always fail in practice.</p>
