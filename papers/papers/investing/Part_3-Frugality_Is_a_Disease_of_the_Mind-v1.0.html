  Is a Disease of the Mind: Why Spendthrifts Fail</h2>
  <h2
  id="being-cheap-is-very-expensive.-more-expensive-than-you-will-ever-realize.">Being
  cheap is very expensive. More expensive than you will ever
  realize.</h2>
  <p>Cheapness doesn't just cost you money—it costs you life. The person
  who clips coupons and hesitates over a $12 lunch turns every decision
  into a monetary loss calculation. They become socially awkward because
  saying yes to anything—a dinner, a trip, a small investment in a
  relationship or opportunity—feels like bleeding cash. They avoid
  modest costs that would open doors, build networks, or create leverage
  later. Everything is framed as loss, so they miss compounding in the
  only place it really matters: human connections, experiences, and
  asymmetric upside.</p>
  <p>The cheap mind sees the world through a pinhole: "Is this worth the
  dollars right now?" It never asks "What could this become?" or "Who
  could this connect me to?" So opportunities that require a little
  friction or upfront spend get left on the table. The cheap person ends
  up isolated, stagnant, and ironically poorer in every meaningful
  metric—time, relationships, knowledge, optionality—than someone who
  spent modestly to keep doors open.</p>
  <h2
  id="spendthrift-on-the-other-hand-is-just-a-child-with-no-sense-of-control.">Spendthrift,
  on the other hand, is just a child with no sense of control.</h2>
  <p>All opportunity must be experienced. All temptation must be
  fulfilled. The spendthrift sees money (or risk capital) as the ticket
  to instant ownership of every shiny thing. A new idea, a hot stock, a
  night out, leverage on a trade—it's all "mine now." No delay, no
  filter. The rush of acquisition is the reward, not the outcome. Wins
  feel like proof they're right; losses feel like bad luck or someone
  else's fault. The cup overflows fast, greed takes the wheel, and they
  chase the next dopamine hit until the account is empty or the margin
  call arrives.</p>
  <p>Like the emotional cup, you must find your balance. For some people
  that sweet spot is a 4—slightly cautious, mildly pessimistic, enough
  edge to stay sharp without freezing. For others it's a 6—lightly
  optimistic, energized by action, enough juice to pull the trigger
  without going reckless. The exact number doesn't matter as much as
  knowing where yours lives and refusing to let it swing wildly.</p>
  <p>This bias—this default money personality—probably sets in by the
  age of 20 and becomes your permanent state. Don't fight it like it's a
  flaw to be cured. You won't "fix" it through willpower alone. Learn to
  work with it.</p>
  <h2 id="if-youre-naturally-cheap">If you're naturally cheap:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Force yourself to spend when the math says yes but your gut
  screams no.</p></li>
  <li><p>Build rules that require you to act on high-conviction ideas
  even if it means parting with cash.</p></li>
  <li><p>Remind yourself that hoarding cash is the ultimate opportunity
  cost.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="if-youre-naturally-spendthrift">If you're naturally
  spendthrift:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Force yourself to sit on your hands when the cup is full and
  everything feels urgent.</p></li>
  <li><p>Build rules that cap position size, require waiting periods, or
  demand written justification before any trade.</p></li>
  <li><p>Treat every "must-have" impulse like a child throwing a
  tantrum—acknowledge it, then ignore it until the rational mind cools
  off.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The saver who never spends misses the compounding that comes from
  calculated risk. The spender who never saves blows up before
  compounding can even begin. Both are diseased in their extremes. The
  cure isn't becoming the opposite—it's recognizing your default wiring,
  monitoring the cup level, and designing guardrails so your natural
  bias doesn't run the show unchecked.</p>
  <p>Frugality isn't virtue. Reckless spending isn't freedom. Both are
  just unchecked personality traits masquerading as strategy. The only
  thing that wins long-term is the person who knows their default
  setting, respects its power, and forces rational override when the cup
  drifts too far from balance.</p>
