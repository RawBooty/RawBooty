  Empty</h1>
  <p>Of all the lessons I can impart on investors, this is the most
  valuable one I've devised. It's a simple little heuristic I call "the
  emotional cup," and it finds its origins in the old expression "is the
  glass half empty or half full?"</p>
  <p>Now, I'll be honest—I'm a bit of a realist, which makes me a
  pessimist in most people's eyes. But that's not the cup we're talking
  about here.</p>
  <p>See, inside of you there's a metaphorical container. When all
  things are calm in your life, on a scale of 1 to 10 your cup is
  sitting right there at a 5. You're calm, cool-headed, relaxed.
  Decisions are easy because you have capacity to think. You're not
  distracted, you're not depressed, you're not excited. You're... well,
  a nice mellow 5.</p>
  <p>But life happens. If the wife, girlfriend, or kid comes over and
  tells you that you need to do something you don't want to do, you
  might drop to a 4.8. They crash your new car? That might push you to a
  7. Excitement raises the level—winning a trade, getting a big bonus,
  seeing your portfolio up 20% in a month. Depression lowers it—losing
  money, bad news, prolonged drawdown.</p>
  <p>How this matters in investing is simple and brutal: when you're
  winning, the cup starts to fill up, and you get greedy, emotional,
  stupid. When you're losing, the cup starts to empty, and you become
  depressed, despondent, stupid.</p>
  <p>The heuristic is dead simple: think of your emotional state as a
  cup. Whenever you feel you're not a 5—or close to it—stop. Get your
  shit together. Rebalance. Then make a decision.</p>
  <p>The best way to lose money is to act in those moments when the cup
  is very full or very empty. Odds are you're at your best somewhere
  between a 4 and a 6. A little depression is okay—it sharpens caution.
  A little excitement is okay—it fuels conviction. But push past that
  range and you're in dangerous territory.</p>
  <p>Giving your teenage son a pocket full of money, then asking your
  aunt—you know the one who runs a brothel—to babysit probably isn't a
  great idea. Too much money, too much opportunity, and too much
  temptation can corrupt even the most disciplined.</p>
  <p>The same thing happens in markets. A winning streak fills the cup
  fast—greed creeps in, position sizes get bigger, you start chasing,
  you ignore red flags because "this time it's different." The cup
  overflows, and you make reckless bets. A losing streak empties it—fear
  takes over, you cut winners early, you average down into losers, you
  freeze, or worse, you revenge-trade to "get back to even.</p>
  <p>"Either way, the rational mind—the one that should be in
  charge—gets drowned out or starved. You stop thinking clearly because
  the emotional capacity isn't there.</p>
  <p>This is why the "suit of clothes" fit from the last paper matters
  so much. If your personality is wired for high action and excitement
  (spender/trader type), your cup fills and empties faster in volatile
  regimes—you're more prone to overflow on wins and crash on losses. If
  you're wired for patience and calm (saver/value type), your cup stays
  steadier, but prolonged boredom or drawdowns can slowly drain it until
  you're numb and quit.</p>
  <p>The fix isn't to become emotionless (impossible). It's to monitor
  the cup level constantly. Before any trade, any add, any cut—ask:
  Where's my cup right now? If it's way above 6 or way below 4, walk
  away. Do nothing. Journal it. Exercise. Sleep. Talk to someone
  neutral. Whatever resets you back toward 5.I've seen brilliant people
  blow up accounts because they ignored this. I've seen average people
  compound steadily because they respected it. The markets don't care
  about your IQ or your models. They care about whether you can stay
  rational when your own internal state is screaming at you.</p>
  <p>Learn to watch your cup. Respect when it's full or empty. Act only
  when it's balanced. This one habit, more than any strategy or edge,
  will save you more money—and sanity—than almost anything else.</p>
