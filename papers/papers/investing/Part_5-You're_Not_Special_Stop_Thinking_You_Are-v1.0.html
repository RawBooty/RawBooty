  <h1 id="youre-not-special.-stop-thinking-you-are.">You're Not Special.
  Stop Thinking You Are.</h1>
  <p>For whatever reason, a lot of people like to think they are
  special. They warp their thinking to believe they are due for a win,
  or owed a win. Or they think the world is trying to punish them. Or
  they think they are gifted when they are in fact just lucky.</p>
  <p>There are 8–9 billion people on planet Earth. Earth is less than a
  speck of dust in the cosmic sense. The universe does not care about
  you. Worse, the universe doesn't even know you exist.</p>
  <p>Learn this to your very core.</p>
  <p>Why? Because when the market turns against you—that stock you love,
  the one you spent months researching, told all your friends about,
  built a whole narrative around—you have no control. It doesn't know
  you or care about you. If you're wrong, sell it. The first loss is
  your best loss.</p>
  <p>Don't go telling yourself something magic is going to happen.
  Magical thinking gets people in a lot of trouble.</p>
  <p>This is a long, slow game. If you don't control your losses and
  remain rational at all times, you're not going to make it.</p>
  <p>The moment you realize you don't matter at all is the moment you
  realize that you must take responsibility for your bad decisions and
  correct them. Again: if you're emotional about something, then you're
  not rational.</p>
  <p>Telling people about your positions? This just invests your
  reputation in the position, which makes selling or buying harder. You
  start caring more about looking right than being right. Ego enters the
  room, and ego is a terrible portfolio manager.</p>
  <p>Ken Fisher had a neat trick, articulated in <em>The Only Three
  Questions That Count: Investing by Knowing What Others Don't:</em> run
  your theses past people. If people agree, then you are consensus. If
  they disagree, then you might be onto something. Just don't conflate
  testing your thesis with broadcasting your investments. Get honest
  feedback without turning your idea into a public stake that you feel
  compelled to defend.</p>
  <p>Stay calm. Stay rational. Be a 5.</p>
  <p>This ties straight back to the emotional cup. When you're feeling
  special—due for a win, punished by the market, gifted because you
  "nailed" one trade—your cup is either overflowing with arrogance or
  empty with self-pity. Either way, you're nowhere near 5. You're
  emotional. You're not thinking clearly. You're at risk.</p>
  <p>The universe doesn't owe you a rebound. The stock doesn't owe you
  vindication. Your friends don't owe you validation for being right. No
  one owes you anything.</p>
  <p>When the drawdown hits, when the thesis breaks, when the market
  laughs at your months of work—the only thing that matters is whether
  you can look at the facts coldly and act: cut the loss, rebalance the
  cup, move on.</p>
  <p>Magical thinking says: "This time it's different. It'll come back.
  I deserve this."<br />
  Rational thinking says: "I'm wrong. Cut it. Next.</p>
  <p>"The difference between surviving long enough to catch a real
  dislocation and blowing up in the boring middle is exactly this:
  accepting that you're not special, so your mistakes don't get special
  treatment. They get corrected fast.</p>
  <p>Consider the sunk-cost fallacy in action: you hold a loser because
  you've already invested time, research, reputation. You tell yourself
  the market is "wrong" or "will see the light." That's magical thinking
  dressed as conviction. The universe doesn't care about your sunk
  costs. It just moves prices based on supply, demand, and collective
  opinion. Your story doesn't enter the equation.</p>
  <p>Or take overconfidence after a win: "I spotted this early—I must be
  gifted." One good call doesn't make you special; it makes you lucky
  that time. String a few together, and the ego swells. The cup fills.
  You take bigger risks, ignore warnings, chase the high. Then the loss
  comes, the cup empties, and suddenly you're the victim: "The market
  punished me." No. You punished yourself by abandoning rationality.</p>
  <p>Even the pros fall into this. Many blow up not from bad analysis,
  but from believing their own press—thinking they are the exception,
  the one who "gets it" when everyone else doesn't. The market has no
  favorites. It grinds everyone equally.</p>
  <p>Embrace the indifference of the universe. It frees you. No cosmic
  justice to wait for. No punishment to fear. Just you, your decisions,
  your responsibility.</p>
  <p>When the market doesn't care—and it never will—your only edge is
  staying rational when everyone else is telling themselves stories
  about why they matter.</p>
  <p>Be a 5. Stay there. Act only from there.</p>
  <p>The market is indifferent. Make your peace with that, cut losses
  without drama, test ideas without ego, and wait for the rare
  dislocation without needing to be the hero. That's how you last long
  enough to win.</p>
