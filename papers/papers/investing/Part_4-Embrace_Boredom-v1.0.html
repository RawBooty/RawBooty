  <p>We all want the chemical highs of winning. We all hate the lows
  from losing. But here’s the thing: we are hard-wired to viscerally
  hate boredom. Boredom is the worst.</p>
  <p>How bad is boredom? Clinical studies have actually been conducted
  where they lock people in a room with a button. Pushing the button
  causes pain—mild electric shocks to the ankle or wrist. Given enough
  time, people will engage in purposeful self-harm just to cure the
  agony of boredom. In one famous experiment from the University of
  Virginia (published in Science in 2014), nearly half the participants
  shocked themselves at least once during 15 minutes alone, with some
  men doing it dozens or even hundreds of times. They’d rather feel pain
  than sit with their own thoughts and nothing to do. Follow-up studies
  (Maastricht University, 2016) showed boredom specifically drives this
  behavior more than sadness or neutral states, and people with a
  history of non-suicidal self-injury were even quicker and more intense
  about it. The conclusion is clear: boredom is so aversive that many
  prefer physical discomfort to the emptiness.</p>
  <p>Now… how the hell does this apply to investing? Well, I got bad
  news for you: this is a seriously boring job.</p>
  <p>Why? Because real opportunity is rare.</p>
  <p>Your job—if you want to do this seriously—is to constantly,
  patiently, methodically search for those rare moments and act only on
  those rare moments. That’s it. The rest is waiting.</p>
  <p>Being fully invested all the time keeps the sell-side fed
  (commissions, spreads, ideas, narratives) and makes your life much
  harder. You only need a few good trades in your life to get super
  rich. The key is to embrace boredom. Learn to love it. Find hobbies,
  learn, read, expand your mind while you patiently wait for something
  to do.</p>
  <p>Bought a stock? Great. Enjoy being bored owning it.</p>
  <p>Richard Russell of Dow Theory Letters once brilliantly noted that
  the difference between a rich person and a poor person is really quite
  simple: the rich person can afford to wait.</p>
  <p>What does this mean? The rich person doesn’t need to be invested to
  get rich. He or she can sit on his or her hands and do nothing for a
  very long time, waiting for opportunity to come to them. Then they
  act.</p>
  <p>A poor person? Well, they need money to keep the lights on and the
  kids fed, so they don’t wait. They try to make opportunity. The
  problem is, no matter how hard you try, you can’t go to the fish—you
  must let the fish come to you.</p>
  <p>Trying to force trades because you’re bored is like going fishing
  with dynamite. You might catch something, but you’re more likely to
  blow up your pond, scare everything away, and end up with nothing but
  regret.</p>
  <p>The emotional cup ties in here directly. Boredom empties the cup
  slowly—chronic low-level drain. You feel restless, antsy, like you’re
  “missing out.” The cup drops below 4, and suddenly you’re
  rationalizing marginal ideas, increasing size on mediocre setups, or
  revenge-trading after a small loss just to feel something. The boredom
  becomes its own emotional trigger, pushing you into stupid action.</p>
  <p>The antidote isn’t forcing excitement. It’s learning to
  tolerate—and eventually enjoy—the emptiness.</p>
  <p>If you’re wired as a spender/trader type (from the last paper),
  boredom is torture. Your brain craves stimulation, action, dopamine.
  Sitting still feels like death. You’ll invent reasons to trade because
  waiting hurts more than losing sometimes.</p>
  <p>If you’re wired as a saver/value type, boredom might feel more
  natural—but prolonged cash drag or “nothing happening” can still erode
  you into apathy, second-guessing, or premature selling just to feel
  productive.</p>
  <p>Either way, the market doesn’t reward hyperactivity. It rewards the
  person who can sit through years of nothing and still be ready when
  the dislocation arrives.</p>
  <p>Embrace boredom means:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Stop measuring your worth by how many trades you make or how
  “active” you look.</p></li>
  <li><p>Build a life outside markets so waiting doesn’t feel like
  punishment.</p></li>
  <li><p>Treat cash as a position—not dead money, but
  ammunition.</p></li>
  <li><p>When the cup starts emptying from inactivity, recognize it as a
  signal to reset, not to act.</p></li>
  <li><p>Remember: the rich person waits. The poor person
  chases.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>You don’t get rich by being busy. You get rich by being right a few
  times, at scale, and having the discipline to wait between those
  times.</p>
  <p>Boredom isn’t the enemy. It’s the price of admission for the rare
  moments that actually matter. Learn to love the wait, or the market
  will teach you the hard way.</p>
