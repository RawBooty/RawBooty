  <p><strong>Branding: Learn to Make Friends, Not Pictures</strong></p>
  <p><em>(Understanding Identity Through Evolutionary
  Psychology)</em></p>
  <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Company brands didn’t exist until the
  19th century. Ivory Soap (1879) was among the first true modern
  brands—named, nationally advertised, with claims of purity and the
  famous <em>“It Floats.”</em> Before that, people bought soap from
  <em>the guy who makes soap.</em></p>
  <p>Ever wonder why we have last names like Shoemaker, Smith, Tailor,
  Baker? In small towns, your name plus your job <em>was</em> your
  identity. That was your brand.</p>
  <p>Incidentally, the word <em>brand</em> originally meant a mark
  burned into cattle to designate ownership. Early branding was simple.
  The message: “<em>this cow is mine.”</em></p>
  <p>Modern branding is the same thing—except now it’s a claim on your
  mind.</p>
  <p>For over 300,000 years of human history, there were no logos. No
  taglines. No brand guidelines. Humans lived in small groups and knew
  each other directly. We did not evolve with abstract corporate
  entities, and our brains still have no native slot for them.</p>
  <p>What we <em>do</em> have is wiring for people: names, faces,
  personalities, relationships. That wiring explains why people form
  deep emotional bonds with brands like Disney or Harley-Davidson.</p>
  <p>To build a brand that actually works, you need to understand one
  thing:</p>
  <p>Customers don’t experience your brand as a <em>thing.</em> They
  experience it as a meta-person. A pseudo-human. This isn’t metaphor.
  It’s developmental and evolutionary psychology. Identity isn’t
  rational—it’s tribal. Your brain treats brands like people because
  that’s the only system it has.</p>
  <p>The core realization: there is only one way to build a lasting
  brand—make it a person.<br />
  Give it a name. A personality. Quirks. Utility. Emotional hooks that
  resemble human relationships.</p>
  <p>Everything else is forgettable noise.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Definitions</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The Brand as Person</strong></p>
  <p>Your brand occupies a slot in the customer’s mental social network.
  Research suggests humans can recognize and remember roughly 5,000
  faces and names (estimates range from 1,000 to 10,000). This is not
  infinite—it’s a hard cognitive limit inherited from our
  hunter-gatherer past. Training can expand it slightly, but most people
  cap out.</p>
  <p>That’s 5,000 total.<br />
  Not 5,000 people <em>and</em> 5,000 brands.</p>
  <p>Think about it this way: Do you allocate a slot to remember your
  best friend’s kid’s name… or someone else’s company? That’s the
  friction you’re fighting.</p>
  <p>Your brand isn’t competing for “mindshare.” It’s competing for one
  of those finite slots, the same way a friend, rival, or enemy would.
  If your brand doesn’t feel like a person, it gets dropped. Personality
  trumps aesthetics. And yes—<em>the word “Trump” does a lot of
  work.</em></p>
  <p>A brand’s personality isn’t fluff. It’s the traits that form bonds:
  reliable (a dependable friend),<br />
  bold (a charismatic leader), shocking (that unforgettable jerk you met
  in college).</p>
  <p>Logos and colors are just the face. The real work is identity. What
  does this “person” stand for?<br />
  How does it make people feel? Utility and emotion seal the deal.</p>
  <p>Apple isn’t a computer company. Steve Jobs built a friendly, sexy,
  rebellious innovator who empowers creators. Nike isn’t footwear—it’s a
  relentless motivator whispering <em>“just do it.”</em></p>
  <p>These are the virtual people you “know” and trust.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Scoring System</strong></p>
  <p><em>(This Is Where People Get Confused)</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Weak person</strong> → your brand fades (forgettable,
  like naming your kid John)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Solid person</strong> → loyalty (customers “know” you;
  repeat business)</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Iconic person</strong> → dominance (one of those 5,000
  slots locked forever)</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most brands fail because they think a clever name or pretty design
  is enough. It isn’t. Without personality, you’re not a person—you’re
  wallpaper. And wallpaper isn’t remembered.</p>
  <p>Think about it: how many ads can you recall where you remember the
  product or the joke, but not the brand? That’s why.</p>
  <p>Brands aren’t inventions. They’re evolutionary hacks. Ignore the
  marketing gurus selling “brand strategy” as modern art. This is
  Psychology 101.</p>
  <p>Humans evolved to track alliances: who’s useful, who’s dangerous,
  who’s trustworthy. Brands hijack that circuitry. A successful brand
  does what a human name does—instant recognition, emotional
  association, memorability.</p>
  <p>Common names blend in. Unique ones stick—even when
  controversial.</p>
  <p>George Foreman named all his kids George. He called it a gift:
  instant memorability in a sea of forgettables.</p>
  <p>Names come with embedded context you can hijack.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>About “<em>rawbooty”</em></strong></p>
  <p>Shocking? Offensive? Absolutely.</p>
  <p>Memorable? Unavoidably.</p>
  <p><em>“rawbooty”</em> checks the boxes and captures a slot and squats
  there—especially once you understand the definition and the
  purpose.</p>
  <p>Was it comfortable to adopt? No. But we’re in good company.
  Consider Kum &amp; Go, Hooker Furniture, Big Ass Fans. The world is
  full of cheeky, abrasive brands that stick because neutrality
  doesn’t.</p>
  <p>People don’t remember “<em>rawbooty”</em> because it’s polite. They
  remember it because it has a personality: raw, unfiltered,
  provocative. That’s the edge.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Real Mistake</strong></p>
  <p>Treating branding as visuals or slogans is a mistake. “Let’s get a
  cool logo” isn’t the answer. That’s like dressing a corpse—it looks
  nice, but it doesn’t breathe. Worse is bland neutrality: medium
  personality, average utility, no emotional pull. You end up as that
  acquaintance people vaguely recognize but never call. In saturated
  markets, this kills you faster than a bad product. Competitors with
  stronger personalities steal your slots.</p>
  <p>Constraints matter more than creativity. You don’t freely choose
  your brand’s personality—your business forces it.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Solo operator? Your brand is you: gritty, human,
  authentic.</p></li>
  <li><p>Scaling fast? Your brand must become a consistent person
  systems can maintain.</p></li>
  <li><p>Niche market? Be hyper-specific—the expert friend for that
  tribe.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fake it, and it collapses.</p>
  <p>A “fun” brand run by a joyless founder rings hollow. Customers feel
  the mismatch immediately. Trust dies fast and resurrects slowly.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Execution Beats Inspiration</strong></p>
  <p>Execution means <em>living</em> the personality. Every tweet,
  email, product decision, and interaction reinforces it. Building a
  virtual person is hard. Customers test brands the way they test
  friends—through screwups, delays, stress, and success. Pass the tests
  and earn loyalty. Fail, and you’re ghosted.</p>
  <p>Memorability has costs. Shock risks backlash, filters, shadow bans.
  Utility builds slow trust. Emotional traits demand
  vulnerability—brands that claim to care must actually deliver.</p>
  <p>None of this is easy. Choose what fits, choose what you think you
  can execute. Just don’t choose rawbooty – it’s already taken.</p>
  <p>It’s a game of psychological warfare for those 5,000 slots. In the
  trade this is called “mindshare”.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
  <p>There’s really only one way to reliably build a successful brand:
  make it a person.</p>
  <p>Humans see meta-people, not abstractions. Give your brand a
  memorable name, a distinct personality, real utility, and emotional
  gravity.</p>
  <p>And don’t kid yourself: if you can’t compete on utility, price, or
  service, branding won’t save you. <em>Acme Flypaper</em> still wins if
  it’s a better quality product, that costs less, and is back by
  excellent customer service.</p>
  <p>No brand ever overcomes that. Respect your limits.</p>
