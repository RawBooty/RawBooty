  <p><strong>Marketing: Don’t Burn Your Friends</strong></p>
  <p><em>(What Not to Do When You Finally Have Something Worth
  Selling)</em></p>
  <p>You’ve nailed market fit.<br />
  You’re winning (or damn close) on one or two of the three axes.<br />
  Your brand feels like a person.<br />
  There’s cash in the tank.</p>
  <p>Time to market.</p>
  <p>Bad news: 99% of what passes for “marketing” is wasted money.</p>
  <p>TV. Radio. Paid social. Agencies. You’d get better ROI wiring the
  cash to a stranger and asking them to kick you in the ass
  personally.</p>
  <p>Why does McDonald’s advertise nonstop? Not to build brand—they
  already own the mindshare slot for <em>fast burgers</em>. Their ads
  defend frequency, not awareness: think burger → feel hungry → buy.
  Coca-Cola does the same thing. Omnipresent reminders timed to
  thirst.</p>
  <p>Incumbents defend frequency because awareness is already
  locked.</p>
  <p>Your problem is different—and harder.</p>
  <p>As a new or small player, you’re fighting uphill on two fronts:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Awareness: no one knows you exist</p></li>
  <li><p>Education: if your offer solves something complex, people don’t
  even know they need it</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This paper isn’t a how-to playbook. That’s a library, not a
  lesson.</p>
  <p>This is the first and most important rule: What not to do.</p>
  <p>Because mindshare is brutally hard to earn—and ridiculously easy to
  lose.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Marketing Is Relationship Management</strong></p>
  <p>Warren Buffett put it plainly during the Salomon Brothers
  crisis:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>“Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred
  of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The subtlety in this quote is where the value lives. Your job as a
  marketer isn’t to <em>sell</em>. It’s to earn—or keep—<em>a
  friend</em>. This follows directly from our branding paper: your brand
  is a pseudo-person. Marketing is how that person behaves toward real
  people.</p>
  <p>Pester a friend constantly? They block you.</p>
  <p>Act desperate? They ghost—or worse, exploit you.</p>
  <p>(Sad, but human.)</p>
  <p>Practically speaking: when someone gives you their email, phone
  number, or attention, that’s trust. Treat it like it’s scarce and
  precious- <em>because it is</em>.</p>
  <p>Most companies grind for years, spending a fortune, building
  distribution lists, then light them on fire with the logic: “1M emails
  = $1M sales. Low cost, high ROI.”</p>
  <p>Short-term bump. Long-term incineration of precious goodwill. Spam
  filters tighten. Engagement collapses. Trust evaporates. What took
  10–20 years to earn dies in weeks for incremental cash.</p>
  <p>A real friend only reaches out with value—relevant, timely,
  useful.</p>
  <p>Scale <em>that</em>:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Infrequent contact</p></li>
  <li><p>Small, targeted segments</p></li>
  <li><p>Personalize where possible</p></li>
  <li><p>Always lead with utility</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Not “BUY NOW” desperation.</p>
  <p>Nike says <em>Just Do It</em>.<br />
  We say <em>Don’t do it</em>.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Another Deadly Trap: Discounts and Sales</strong></p>
  <p>Discounts don’t earn customers. They attract opportunists and
  parasites. They weaken your brand and punish the loyal customers who
  paid full price.</p>
  <p>Price-chasers buy only on deal. They churn fast and leave zero
  loyalty. The 80:20 rule applies. 80% of your profit usually comes from
  20% of your customers. Don’t burn the 20 to grow the 80. This is bad
  business.</p>
  <p>Frequent cuts broadcast one message: “We can’t sell at value.”</p>
  <p>Frequent sales turn your pseudo-person (your brand) into the
  desperate acquaintance begging for money.</p>
  <p>Your real customers notice this behavior and feel taken advantage
  of: “I paid full price last month. Now it’s 40% off for strangers?”
  this erodes trust. Referrals dry up. Defection follows.</p>
  <p>If you must discount—clear inventory, seasonal pressure, pricing
  tests—do it carefully:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Reward your best customers privately (VIP perks, early access,
  gratitude)</p></li>
  <li><p>Dump excess through hidden channels (outlets, wholesalers,
  flash sites your core audience doesn’t track)</p></li>
  <li><p>Keep it rare and unpredictable—never habitual</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Better alternatives:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Bundles</p></li>
  <li><p>Free add-ons</p></li>
  <li><p>Loyalty rewards</p></li>
  <li><p>Referrals</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Add value without slashing price.</p>
  <p>Discounts train customers to wait for more discounts. Is this your
  goal?<br />
  Discounts also devalue perceived quality. It cheapens your value
  proposition.</p>
  <p>Discounts shift customer loyalty from brand personality and utility
  to price alone.</p>
  <p>This is fragile and self-destructive.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Scoring System</strong></p>
  <p><em>(Where People Screw Up)</em></p>
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>Burn friends fast</strong> (blasts + broad discounts) →
  short-term cash, long-term death</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Respect boundaries</strong> → steady, compounding
  loyalty</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Become indispensable</strong> → defensible moat (rare,
  enduring)</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The best marketing advice is brutally simple:</p>
  <p>Be a better friend.</p>
  <p>This is really all you have to do to win business.</p>
  <p>Offer value first.<br />
  Sell second—or never overtly.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Constraints Matter</strong></p>
  <p>Low budget? Prioritize earned and organic: referrals, useful
  content, word of mouth.</p>
  <p>High budget? Same rule applies. Ads, when done right, amplify real
  friendships; they almost never create them from strangers.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Execution Beats Tactics</strong></p>
  <p>Funnels, retargeting, A/B tests—these are tools. The problem
  remains that desperate behavior kills faster than bad tactics.
  Over-blasting, public fire sales, constant promos accelerate
  failure.</p>
  <p>Live the <em>friend</em> personality in every touchpoint.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Bottom Line</strong></p>
  <p>Marketing preserves and deepens the relationship your brand
  (pseudo-person) has already earned.</p>
  <p>One bad blast, one public discount, one desperate grab for
  cash.</p>
  <p>That’s all it takes to torch years of goodwill and hard work.</p>
  <p>Respect your customers time, protect their privacy, and reward them
  with the attention a real friend deserves. Always lead with utility to
  your customer; do not look to find utility in them.</p>
  <p>And remember: if you can’t win on price, quality, or service, no
  marketing will save you.</p>
  <p>But if you <em>can</em>—don’t sabotage the mindshare you fought so
  hard to earn.</p>
  <p>It’s a game of psychological warfare for those 5,000 slots.<br />
  In the trade, this is called mindshare.</p>
