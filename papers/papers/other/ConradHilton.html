    <div class="intro">
      <p>Hilton wrote this chapter as an open, practical guide to rational living and personal success. Copies were placed in every Hilton hotel room for decades, reflecting his intent for wide dissemination. Preserved here as a cultural artifact illustrating emotional-vs-rational self-valuation: discovering unique talent, thinking big, uncompromising honesty, full enthusiasm, detachment from possessions, and prayer as the hub of a fulfilled life.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Chapter 14: There Is an Art to Living</h2>

      <p>Each of us strives for success. The housewife, the statesman, the carpenter, saint or businessman, for each forward momentum is established by the desire to accomplish, prosper, grow in his chosen field.</p>

      <p>What is this thing—success?</p>

      <p>It cannot be measured by the accumulation of money. Too many rich men are failures and too many poor men masters at the art of living to make this the criterion.</p>

      <p>The workman is worthy of his hire, yes, but you cannot reckon his achievements by his bank account. Mahatma Gandhi, one of the most successful statesmen of our time, left upon his death as his entire worldly estate: two rice bowls, one spoon, two pairs of sandals, his copy of the Bhagavad-Gita, his spectacles and an old-fashioned turnip watch. Helen Keller, another outstanding success, overcame tremendous handicaps to prove that the blind deaf-mute was not mentally retarded, unreachable, thus setting free hundreds of her fellow sufferers. She has succeeded in raising many, many thousands of dollars to benefit her fellows. Yet Miss Keller herself has had only the most ordinary personal comforts. Saint Francis of Assisi during his lifetime affected his entire world, rulers and princes, prelates, artists, businessmen, farmers and housewives. Seven hundred years after his death he continues to affect people in all walks of life in many countries. Yet his very influence was based on maintaining absolute poverty. He was, perhaps, the most successful poor man who ever lived.</p>

      <p>The yardstick for measuring success would seem to be not how much a man gets as how much he has to give away.</p>

      <p>What do we know of a successful man? The size of his bank account? Never! In my own county of Socorro they have finally adjudged me a success, not because I bought the Waldorf, but because I was able to give as a memorial to Gus and Mary Hilton a new school and convent to the Sisters of Loretto—the Hilton Mount Carmel School and Convent. Albert Schweitzer is known because he gives his services in a far-off hospital in Africa; Arturo Rubinstein because the beauty of his music gives inspiration and joy; Bob Hope because he knows the spiritual value of laughter.</p>

      <p>The true fruits of successful living are not material. They are contentment, the joy of usefulness, growth through the fulfillment of our particular talent. Viewed this way God is always on the side of success for the objective is fulfilling a talent He gave, and which He will support and maintain.</p>

      <p>To me there are ten ingredients which must be blended in each and every one of us if we are to live successfully. The first is:</p>

      <h3>Find Your Own Particular Talent</h3>
      <p>As surely as none of us was given the same thumb print, so surely none of us possesses the exact same talent. This does not mean there will not be two housewives, two carpenters, two artists or two hotel men. We each have two thumbs. But the individual print is uniquely our own.</p>

      <p>Emerson says, "Each man has his own vocation. The talent is the call . . . He inclines to do something which is easy for him, and good when it is done, but which no other man can do . . . His ambition is exactly proportioned to his powers. The height of the pinnacle is determined by the breadth of the base."</p>

      <p>Finding this particular talent or vocation is the first step in the art of successful living. Great frustration and the feel of failure can be present in the face of material success if we follow someone else's footsteps rather than our own.</p>

      <p>Don't worry if it takes a little time to find your own niche!</p>

      <p>It took me thirty-two years and I started out to be a banker. History proves that this isn't shameful. George Washington began as a surveyor. Somerset Maugham graduated in medicine before he took up the pen. Norman Vincent Peale was a newspaperman for some years. Albert Schweitzer was a theologian, a musician until he was thirty, when he resigned as principal of the Theological College of St. Thomas to become a medical student and devote the rest of his life to healing the sick and suffering African natives. St. Peter, the Rock, was first a fisherman.</p>

      <p>This is no invitation to become a drifter, a professional malcontent. But every man has a right, a duty I would say, to search humbly and prayerfully for the place where he fits into the Divine pattern. I am encouraging boldness because the danger of our seniority and pension plans tempt a young man to settle in a rut named Security rather than find his own rainbow.</p>

      <p>Don't worry about what you haven't got in the way of talent. Find out what you <strong>have</strong>!</p>

      <p>A very poor Greek once applied for a job as janitor in a bank in Athens. "Can you write?" demanded the discriminating head of employment. "Only my name," said the fellow. He didn't get the job—so he borrowed the money to travel steerage to the United States, the Land of Opportunity. Many years later an important Greek businessman held a press conference in his beautiful Wall Street offices. At the conclusion an enterprising reporter said, "You should write your memoirs." The gentleman smiled. "Impossible," he said, "I cannot write." The reporter was astounded. "Just think," he remarked, "how much further you would have gone if you could." The Greek shook his head. "If I could write," he said, "I'd be a janitor."</p>

      <h3>Be Big: Think Big. Act Big. Dream Big.</h3>
      <p>Your value is determined by the mold you yourself make. It doesn't take any more energy to expect to be the best housewife, the finest cook, the most capable carpenter.</p>

      <p>It has been my experience that the way most people court failure is by misjudging their abilities, belittling their worth and value. Did you ever think what can happen to a plain bar of iron, worth about $5.00? The same iron when made into horseshoes is worth $10.50. If made into needles, it is worth $3,250.85, and if turned into balance springs for watches its value jumps to $250,000.</p>

      <p>The same is true of another kind of material—You!</p>

      <p>Here is another example. Millet, the French painter, paid twenty-five cents for a yard of canvas. He paid fifty more for a brush and some paints. Onto this quarter's worth of canvas he put all the glory of his biggest visions, his biggest dreams, and gave us a painting called "The Angelus," which brought $105,000.</p>

      <p>I recall an occasion not long ago when the temptation to limited thinking had me convinced a certain project was beyond me. The goal was to raise $400,000 for St. John's Hospital. Irene Dunne, Willard Keith and Louis B. Mayer, members of the committee, thought I might undertake to raise that amount. I thought differently. Interested as I was and eager to contribute personally, raising such a large sum, a few hundred dollars here, a few hundred there, even with an occasional thousand thrown in, was a full-time job—a tremendous, long task—and I felt if they pinned their hopes on me, I might very well disappoint them. Better to admit I wasn't big enough and let them find someone who was.</p>

      <p>When I sat down with the lovely Irene, I was all ready to say, "I can't do it," when suddenly I realized instead that I could do it. Instead of attempting it the little way, trying to get $200 from two thousand people, I would go at it the big way. I would write a sort of chain letter to a selected number of men who could afford large donations. Hopefully I would assign enough to each one to cover the entire amount. In reserve I held a substitute list of men who could afford to contribute half the assigned amount—and so on. If a man on the first team turned me down, I put in two substitutes. If the two substitutes failed me, I sent out four letters. It was simple—and it worked. I had done what I figured I couldn't do by raising my sights.</p>

      <h3>Be Honest</h3>
      <p>What I have in mind is something more than the negative virtues of not cheating, not lying, not stealing. It is a bold, direct, open stand for the truth as we know it, both to ourselves and others. My mother had two old-fashioned quotations she dished out with our oatmeal. The first was Shakespeare: "To thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night the day, Thou canst not then be false to any man." The second was Sir Walter Scott: "Oh, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive!"</p>

      <p>Once you start it, there's no place that deception can stop—and of course it has to start with self-deception, even if it's only the self-deception of believing we can get away with it. True, sometimes we are not "discovered." But all of modern psychology and psychiatry is based on the belief that our self-deceptions drive things into our subconscious where they make all kinds of trouble.</p>

      <p>Myself, I believe if my mother's two bromides from ancient authors were something more than words to cross-stitch on a sampler they would work better than tranquility pills.</p>

      <p>I have never in my whole life found anything to fear from telling the full, direct truth. And that includes instances when "a little judicious evasion" was recommended.</p>

      <p>Particularly I remember an important court case in El Paso during the Depression which meant a great deal in my "personal recovery act." The opposing attorney asked me where certain records were kept, and I replied they were in a certain minute book of meetings held.</p>

      <p>"Where is that minute book?" he asked.</p>

      <p>"In my office in Dallas," I said.</p>

      <p>"Could you get it before court convenes tomorrow?" he asked.</p>

      <p>Now that was a specific question calling for a specific answer. Could I? I could. "Someone from my office," I said, "could take it to the airport and give it to the pilot and the pilot could bring it in."</p>

      <p>My lawyer, Thornton Hardie, was furious. "I know, I know," he said testily. "You only told the truth. But did you have to volunteer? I've a feeling there could be some things in that minute book very damaging to our case."</p>

      <p>At five minutes of ten the next morning, however, it was in our hands. "Well," said Hardie, holding it as though it was a hot potato, "if you can be rash, I'll go you one better."</p>

      <p>Without looking inside he strode in and placed it on opposing counsel's table. The opposing counsel was so sure that, had there been anything to our disadvantage in the minute book we wouldn't have been willing to let him see it, that he never opened it. It lay on his table from ten until the noon recess at which time my attorney picked it up and it was never mentioned again.</p>

      <h3>Live with Enthusiasm</h3>
      <p>It has been my experience that there is nothing worth doing that can be done without it. Ability you must have, but ability sparked with enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is an inexhaustible force, so mighty that you must ever tame and temper it with wisdom. Use it and you will find yourself constantly moving forward to new forms of expression.</p>

      <p>If you have enthusiasm for life you cannot ever know an inactive time of life. Sir Christopher Wren, the famed architect who built fifty-two churches in London, retired from public life at eighty-six. After that he spent five years in literary, astronomical and religious pursuits. Cato, at eighty, studied Greek; and Plutarch, almost as old, Latin. Titian painted a masterpiece at ninety-eight. Verdi wrote his great opera, Othello, at seventy-four, and Falstaff at eighty. What is that but continued enthusiasm for life?</p>

      <p>Everyone faces hardships along their chosen path. What carries them through? Makes them work and pray with no thought of quitting? Enthusiasm! After working long and hard to accumulate his first $50, Frank Woolworth saw three of his first five chain stores fail. The Saturday Evening Post lost $800,000 for Cyrus H. K. Curtis before a single dollar of profit came in. Twenty-seven million dollars and eleven years of work were behind the first pound of Nylon sold by DuPont.</p>

      <p>There is no such thing as being "a little bit enthusiastic." You either are or aren't. If you aren't you face failure and boredom. You can't take it by the spoonful.</p>

      <p>After World War I, a great cholera epidemic struck the Orient. Periodically it has swept through India, the Malay Peninsula, Burma—but never China. The cholera germ cannot survive boiling water and the Chinese drink tea almost exclusively. The American doctors knew this and, when the epidemic threatened to run wild in the Philippines, they ordered the people to boil their water. But cholera continued and, when health inspectors investigated, they found the people were taking three or four teaspoons of boiled water daily, like medicine—and drinking ordinary water.</p>

      <p>It cannot be done that way. Enthusiasm, to be effective, cannot be taken by the spoonful. It must sweep into every department of your life—your religion, your chosen job, your home, your recreation. Only this way can the inexhaustible force be released in your life and carry you forward, protect you, inspire you, in the art of living.</p>

      <h3>Don't Let Your Possessions Possess You</h3>
      <p>I have in my lifetime had everything—and nothing. In my Bible it doesn't say that money is the root of all evil, but the "love of" money. I believe that to be true and I believe the exact same to be true about possessions.</p>

      <p>They are very nice to have, to enjoy, to share. But if you find even one that you can't live without—hasten to give it away. Your very freedom depends on it.</p>

      <p>We have all heard of the lack of sense of the monkey who will put his paw into the narrow mouth of a bottle, grasp a desired nut or bit of food, and refuse to let it go even though the fist he has made makes his hand too large to draw it from the bottle again. "Silly thing," we say, "he hasn't really got the food—he's attached to the bottle." But he has really got the food—and he's attached to the bottle. All he has to do is open his hand and let go?</p>

      <p>We laugh. But is it so funny? The monkey has lost his freedom. Do we guard ourselves from falling into the same trap?</p>

      <h3>Don't Cling to the Past</h3>
      <p>Not through regret. Not through longing. To do so is to tie yourself to a memory. Yesterday is gone. It is wisdom to profit by yesterday's mistakes. It is fatal to hang onto yesterday's victories. Yesterday's future should be expanding. Yesterday's experiences are the foundation upon which his eyes build today.</p>

      <p>A man walking with his eyes turned backward is very apt to fall into a ditch. It has been said that if I have had to let go of success, then I've had to let go of many times to build an expanding future, then I've had released many yesterdays. We can only act now and then look forward to more activity, greater fulfillment.</p>

      <p>To be haunted by past failures or satisfied with past successes is to arrest forward motion.</p>

      <p>We should be just starting each day. In 325 B.C., a famous Athenian general, Iphicrates, was twitted by Harmodius, descendant of a long line of illustrious forebears, for being the son of a shoemaker. The general replied: "My family history begins with me, but yours ends with your ancestors."</p>

      <p>To cling to the past in any way is the beginning of the end.</p>

      <h3>Look Up to People and Down to No One</h3>
      <p>Your neighbor? Do you know him?</p>

      <p>In New York City, a man standing at 50th Street and Park Avenue was waiting for the light to turn. Who is he? To the statistician standing at the window high above, he is a unit in a crowd. To the physicist in a formula of mass and energy; to the chemist, a compound of substances. He is of interest to the historian as one of the billions of beings who have inhabited this planet; to the politician as a vote; to the mailman as an address; to the merchandiser as a customer; to the behaviorist as an animal modified by conditioned reflexes and tags him as a specimen of a particular normal type deviating in one way or another from the alleged norm.</p>

      <p>Each science pinpoints the poor fellow from some particular angle and makes him look foolish, like the candid camera shot that catches you in the middle of a yawn. Let any one of these specialists pigeonhole you and get you to look at yourself through his single-eye lens and what you will see will not be a man, but a fragment of a man. You feel like the blind men who examined the elephant and said: "An elephant is like a blanket." Another said his tail was "like a rope." The third felt his leg and said, "Like a tree." The fourth bumped his side and said, "Like a wall." The elephant last grasped his trunk and said authoritatively . . . "The snake."</p>

      <p>We are blind looking at each other from outside—partially blinded. We do not know each other intimately. Man's splendors, his dreams, his crosses, his weaknesses or strengths. Even our enemies betray us by acts of kindness. Even the only thing that is absolutely sure about us, the common denominator, is that within each is Divine Spark called Life. The solitary Robinson Crusoe, in order to know God, was born in the image and likeness of God.</p>

      <p>The blind beggar, who inhabited his island, Friday, growing had insight until loyalty in trust, confidence, friendship, in fact, welded the unlikely two together.</p>

      <p>As we strive to know more about people, to understand rather than to be understood—"love" our neighbor in a better position to love our neighbor ourselves.</p>

      <h3>Assume Your Full Share of Responsibility for the World in Which You Live</h3>
      <p>Develop your own policy, domestic and foreign. Give it thought. And then own effort. Stand on it! Stand for it! Live it!</p>

      <p>The whole purpose of democracy is for the participation of the individual. The will of the people. You cannot have "government of the people, by the people, for the people" without the active participation of those people.</p>

      <p>Nor can you have a personal success unless you are a citizen, voter, your life share in shaping your own world, tourist.</p>

      <p>The usual answer to that one is: What can a mere individual do?</p>

      <p>I heard Dr. Harry Emerson Fosdick answer that. He said: "Look! What mere individuals are doing now. Who elect our officials? Individuals.</p>

      <p>"Who stand aside and let rotten conditions in our slums beget the tragic shame of dope peddling? Individuals.</p>

      <p>"Believe me, in our present situation, personal character counts. Another good put it 'No rearrangement of bad eggs can make a good omelet.'"</p>

      <p>Our International good Hotels well know the value of each individual tourist, whether as an ambassador or ambassador of good will, a fine testimonial for our way of life—or the reverse.</p>

      <p>We are a nation in our youth.</p>

      <p>What do I mean by that? I mean that from 1776 to 1957, 181 years. When France was that old Charlemagne was just yet born; when Poland 181 years old King Casimir was putting together its primitive government. At that age England had not yet been swallowed up by the Empire of Julius Caesar. The Germans at that stage of growth were still just coming out of the northern forests; Horatius was still at the bridge in Italy; Saint Patrick was just driving the last snakes out of Ireland.</p>

      <p>As a young nation we have vigor, imagination, stamina, we have pride, alert thinking, volatile emotions. Like adolescents; we have neither love nor hate very deeply. With one hand we drop an atom bomb, with the other we deluge the same nation with Marshall Plan wealth. Like youngsters, too, as a nation we are somewhat indifferent at times.</p>

      <p>The successful American will not be indifferent. He will let his enthusiasm sweep into patriotism and be an individual cog in the wheels that lead to a better world. President Eisenhower has truly said: "We are a better world helpless prisoners of individual histories. We are free men." But only so long as prisoners of individual histories. We are free men. But only so long as we are not prisoners of our individual histories. We are free men. But only so long as we are not prisoners of our individual histories.</p>

      <h3>Pray Consistently and Confidently</h3>
      <p>The place was the South Pacific. The time—June, 1945. Virginia Company was the South. The brush was so thick they could not see ten feet in front of them. There had been a path but now ten feet in front of them. The woods in front of them were alive with the enemy and the snarl of bullets whipped through the trees. Suddenly the bullets increased; the aim began to get better; men began to fall.</p>

      <p>"Call headquarters," shouted the leader, "and find out if we can get any help!"</p>

      <p>A few minutes later reserves were on their way to support the company. If Napoleon had been around, he never would have been able to understand. It would have been a mystery to Caesar and to Bismarck, even to General Foch. But every youngster in America today could have told them that it was a "walkie-talkie" that got them out of trouble.</p>

      <p>Walkie-talkie is as old as Adam and Eve. We have all had one since the day we were able to talk. We did not have to wait for the improvements brought on by years of research in the world of radio communications. What I mean is that we have always had prayer. We have always been able to talk to general headquarters any time we wished. And we never had to worry that our Commanding Officer might think our call unimportant, or that we were lacking courage for consulting Him too frequently, or asking advice too often.</p>

      <p>What I like about prayer is that it is a means of communication with God. You can speak to Him any time, night or day, and you can know with certainty that He is listening to you.</p>

      <p>What I like about prayer is that there is no set formula for calling general headquarters on our private walkie-talkie. There are no call letters. You are free to send any message you want. You can just say "hello"; you can ask for something. You can tell Him that things are going rough and you need reinforcements—as those boys in the jungle did. You can call to thank Him for the things He has done for you. You can tell Him you are baffled, bewildered, discouraged or that you are the happiest person in the world.</p>

      <p>For me, in personal living, in fulfilling our place in the world, in faithful use of our talents, each of these is a spoke in the circle of successful living. Prayer is the hub that holds the wheel together. Without living our contact with God we are nothing. With it we are "a little lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor."</p>

      <p>We are successes in the Art of Living.</p>
