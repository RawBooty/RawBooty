  <p><strong>The Four Decisions That Quietly Decide Your
  Life</strong></p>
  <p><em>A simple guide to help navigate life’s biggest
  decisions</em><br />
  <em>(Best read when you’re young: ~13)</em></p>
  <p>If you’re paying attention, you already know that most of life
  feels noisy and kind of pointless. School, jobs, arguments, money,
  status, luck — most of the time is routine, boring, and seemingly
  without meaning. Days pass, patterns repeat, and it’s easy to feel
  like nothing you do really matters.</p>
  <p>Beneath that noise, however, lurk a small number of very big
  decisions that quietly dominate all others. You may not realize it
  yet, but the constant noise of daily life biases you against your own
  long-term self-interest. If you want to live a long, happy, and
  successful life, you need to get a small number of things right — not
  perfectly, just structurally right.</p>
  <p>Not because they happen first, and not because they feel dramatic,
  but because they <strong>lock in risk</strong>.</p>
  <p>For most people, the four decisions that matter most are simple to
  name:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li><p>Who you marry</p></li>
  <li><p>Whether you have children</p></li>
  <li><p>What home you live in</p></li>
  <li><p>What car you drive</p></li>
  </ol>
  <p>These decisions are not equal. They do not carry equal risk, and
  they do not forgive mistakes at the same rate. That’s the bad news.
  The good news is that they can be ranked.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Ranking (by Risk, Not Timing)</strong></p>
  <p>When ranked from highest risk to lowest risk, the list looks like
  this: spouse, children, home, then car.</p>
  <p>This ranking is not a moral judgment; it is a statement of
  structural fact. Who you choose to marry is a foundational choice.
  Where you choose to live is also a foundational choice. The life you
  build — your future — is quite literally set upon these decisions.</p>
  <p>Failures made early in life are typically easier to recover from.
  Failures made later, especially in foundational areas, compound much
  faster. What matters most is not <em>when</em> a decision is made, but
  how large and irreversible it is.</p>
  <p>A bad car choice is painful — it’s expensive and annoying. A bad
  house choice is worse, because it becomes a geographic and financial
  constraint that limits opportunity. But a bad husband or wife? The
  wrong life partner redefines the arc of your future. It removes agency
  and destroys optionality by taking away control. The right choices do
  the opposite.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>A Unifying Principle</strong></p>
  <p>All four decisions share the same underlying structure. They
  involve asymmetric downside, limited upside, false narratives that
  obscure risk, and overconfidence driven by novelty — whether that
  novelty is lust, envy, or status.</p>
  <p>Structurally, they are all the same decision tree. What differs is
  how permanent the damage is when things go wrong.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Cars: The Simplest Case</strong></p>
  <p>When you strip away the stories people tell themselves, a car is a
  lifestyle expense. It is not an investment.</p>
  <p>The moment you take possession, it legally becomes a used car. It
  begins to depreciate immediately. It starts costing money to maintain,
  store, insure, and operate. Your outcome is dominated by two
  variables: the price you paid and the steepness of the depreciation
  curve.</p>
  <p>The correct question is not “What do I want?” or “How cool will
  this make me look?” The correct question is: <em>How easily can I walk
  away from this liability?</em></p>
  <p>A useful guideline is that the purchase price of your car should
  not exceed 3–5% of your net worth. The reason is simple: your car
  should be something you can abandon without damaging your life
  trajectory.</p>
  <p>If that number sounds impossible, it’s because your perspective is
  misaligned. Used cars can be acquired for a few hundred dollars. They
  are not pretty or impressive, but they work. Focus on utility. As your
  wealth rises, so too will your budget and the quality of the car you
  can afford. A car is not an extension of yourself unless you allow it
  to be. If you feel social pressure, the correct response is simply,
  “It does what I need it to do.”</p>
  <p>When buying a car, optimize for the depreciation curve.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Homes: A Lifestyle Expense, Not an Investment</strong></p>
  <p>Like a car, a home is also a lifestyle expense. Once built or
  purchased, it immediately begins to decay and depreciate. This does
  not mean you cannot make money on a home — markets fluctuate and
  leverage exists — but for most people, once you factor in all costs,
  especially opportunity cost, a home is one of the most expensive
  decisions they will ever make.</p>
  <p>The best advice here is to ignore what other people do and tell
  you.</p>
  <p>A home is a concentration of capital. It reduces flexibility,
  increases fixed costs, anchors you to a location, and requires income
  stability. These are not moral flaws, but they are real
  constraints.</p>
  <p>A prudent guideline is to limit the value of your home to roughly
  10–20% of your net worth. For most people, that sounds unrealistic —
  and that’s the point. With time, saving, and discipline, what feels
  impossible at 25 often becomes reasonable at 45. Until then, renting
  preserves optionality. You can walk away from an apartment with little
  penalty. Walking away from a house is slow, expensive, and
  damaging.</p>
  <p>Life-changing opportunities — meeting the right partner, landing
  the right job — are rare and highly sensitive to time and place.
  Optimize for flexibility. Treat appreciation as a bonus, never a
  justification. If you need your home to “work out” financially, you
  have already lost the argument.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Children: An Aspirational Luxury</strong></p>
  <p>Biologically, reproduction is a core human function, but the
  incentives surrounding children have changed. In earlier eras,
  children were an investment: they provided labor, continuity, and
  social insurance. That world no longer exists.</p>
  <p>In the modern age, uncomfortable as it sounds, children are best
  understood as a luxury expense. This is not a judgment; it is a
  classification. Luxury does not mean bad. Luxury means optional,
  expensive, largely intangible in value, and carrying permanent
  downside risk. Financially, the return on investment is negative.</p>
  <p>When framed correctly, children become aspirational rather than
  obligatory. Luxury chosen consciously is empowering and deeply
  appreciated. Luxury assumed without capacity is crushing.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Spouse: The Most Dangerous Decision You Will Ever
  Make</strong></p>
  <p>Marriage is not primarily about romance, emotion, or hope. It is a
  legal contract between you, your spouse, and the government you live
  under. In practical terms, it is a business partnership in the
  enterprise called life.</p>
  <p>Your spouse determines risk tolerance, conflict resolution,
  financial posture, stress behavior, and how failure is handled.
  Physical attraction is biological and front-loaded; it will decay with
  time. People age — that is constant. How they age is the variable.</p>
  <p>Beauty today can become ugly tomorrow. Ugly today may become beauty
  tomorrow.</p>
  <p>What matters most is functional compatibility, and that value is
  almost always back-loaded. It compounds over time. If aesthetic
  enjoyment is your primary selection criterion, you are optimizing for
  early pleasure while locking in later regret.</p>
  <p>Approach partner selection the way you would any other high-stakes
  contract. Inspect the foundation. Read the terms. Stress testing
  should include brutal financial honesty, direct engagement with value
  conflicts, explicit discussion of power dynamics, and realistic
  failure scenarios. This must happen before legal commitment. If both
  partners are rigid in opposite directions, the shared future is
  empty.</p>
  <p>This is not pessimism. It is math.</p>
  <p>Honesty does not negate love; it strengthens it. Projecting a false
  persona to secure a deal almost guarantees failure.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Degradation and Growth</strong></p>
  <p>Some values decay with time, while others grow. Aesthetics fade.
  Familiarity can increase utility. Stability compounds. Misalignment
  accelerates failure. Wise decisions favor back-loaded value over
  front-loaded pleasure. This is why cars, homes, children, and partners
  are not interchangeable.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Final Rule</strong></p>
  <p>You cannot eliminate risk. You can only decide where it lives. Put
  reversible risk early. Put irreversible risk last.</p>
  <p>Never confuse lifestyle with destiny.</p>
  <p>Everything else is commentary.</p>
