  <p><strong>The Business Model of: “Life”</strong><br />
  How to Think About Saving Money</p>
  <p>We are often taught about business using simple examples, like a
  lemonade stand. You sell a product. You earn revenue. You pay
  expenses. What is left is profit. What these examples don’t teach is
  that your life works the same way.</p>
  <p>Your life is a small business; you are a business franchise. If
  your name is John or Debbie, this paper is about learning how to think
  like John Inc. or Debbie Inc.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>So, What Is the Product You Are Selling?</strong></p>
  <p>Every business sells something. In life, as an employee, the
  product you sell is your time. The money you receive for selling your
  time is called a wage. It comes to you as a paycheck. Your paycheck
  tells you how much money you earned by selling units of your time.</p>
  <p>To keep it simple, every hour you work is one unit of product.</p>
  <p>Imagine it takes one hour to bake and sell one cookie. One cookie
  equals one hour of work. If each cookie sells for $20, then each hour
  is worth $20. In the same way, each hour you work is one unit you
  sell.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Income Statement</strong></p>
  <p>Businesses understand their finances using an income statement. The
  same structure applies to life.</p>
  <p><img src="media/media/image1.png"
  style="width:4.11516in;height:1.29185in" /></p>
  <p>What remains at the bottom is what matters. Earning Profit is
  earning freedom. Earning a Loss is a path to future dependency.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>What Are Your Business Expenses?</strong></p>
  <p>No business keeps all of its revenue. There are expenses required
  just to stay in business.</p>
  <p>In life, these are the expenses that make it possible for you to
  sell your time. They include food to live, shelter to protect you from
  heat, cold, and weather, transportation to get to work and buy what
  you need, clothing and hygiene to function in a work environment, and
  taxes.</p>
  <p>These are essential expenses. Different choices can meet the same
  need at very different costs.</p>
  <p>A Lamborghini and a Ford are both transportation. A mansion and a
  studio apartment are both shelter. They serve the same purpose, but at
  very different costs.</p>
  <p>A Ford might cost you $0.50 per mile. A Lamborghini may cost $5.00
  or more per mile. A studio apartment might rent for $50 per night,
  while a mansion may cost $500 per night or more.</p>
  <p>The higher your essential expenses, the more revenue you must earn
  just to stay in business.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>How Do You Earn a Profit?</strong></p>
  <p>Profit is what remains after all expenses are paid. In life, profit
  is the money left over after you pay your essential expenses. This is
  your real income, not the number printed on your paycheck. This is
  what becomes savings.</p>
  <p>Most businesses operate with profit margins between 5% and 12%.
  Below 5% is weak. Above 12% is exceptional.</p>
  <p>You can calculate your own profit margin the same way. If you earn
  $50,000 and save $5,000, your profit margin is 10%. Not bad.</p>
  <p>If nothing is left over, you are not a profitable business.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Borrowing and Losses</strong></p>
  <p>Borrowing introduces a new kind of expense: interest. Interest
  increases your base cost of living.</p>
  <p>When you borrow, you are selling cookies you have not yet baked.
  You are committing hours of your future time before it arrives. In
  life, your supply of time is fixed. Nothing you do will create more of
  it.</p>
  <p>More debt means fewer cookies you get to keep for yourself later.
  It means less life you get to spend the way you want to spend it.</p>
  <p>A business that must borrow to survive is a loss-making business.
  Profit ends the need to borrow.</p>
  <p>Profit allows you to sell fewer hours of your time. This is why
  some people stay broke and others retire early.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>How Profit Grows</strong></p>
  <p>There are only two ways any business increases profit. First,
  reduce expenses. Second, increase the value of what it sells. You can
  reduce expenses, but only to a point. There is a limit to how low
  essential costs can go.</p>
  <p>There is no fixed limit to how valuable your time can become. As
  the value of your time increases, each hour you sell generates more
  revenue. Higher revenue, with controlled expenses, produces
  profit.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>The Final Lesson</strong></p>
  <p>Earlier, we treated your time as a commodity. This was useful, but
  it is not always true.</p>
  <p>Your time is only a commodity if someone else can easily do the
  same task, in the same amount of time, with the same level of quality.
  When this is true, your work is easily replaced. When your work is
  easily replaced, you must accept the market wage. When this is not
  true, your time is not a commodity.</p>
  <p>You should always be looking for ways to increase the value of your
  time.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>An Important Clarification</strong></p>
  <p>Markets value results, not effort.</p>
  <p>If you cannot perform a task at the level the market demands, your
  product is seen as lower quality. A lower-quality product must be sold
  for less, or sold into a market with lower expectations. This means
  your product — you — are a low-quality product in that market.</p>
  <p>To increase the value of your time you must either a) Improve the
  quality of your product or b) find a market with lower standards into
  which you can sell your product.</p>
  <hr />
  <p><strong>Closing Note</strong></p>
  <p>Once you understand how profit is earned, the next question is how
  to invest it.</p>
  <p>For that, I recommend reading <a
