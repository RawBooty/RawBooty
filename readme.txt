# RawBooty

Welcome to RawBooty.

No, this is not a porn site. Sorry if that’s what you were hoping for.

A little etymology:

**Raw** (adj.)  
Directly traces to Old English *hreaw*, meaning “uncooked” or “in a natural, unprocessed state” (Proto-Germanic *khrawaz*, PIE *kreue-*, “raw flesh”). By extension, it came to mean unrefined, unfiltered, crude, or not yet adjusted — as in raw data, raw emotion, or raw exposure. “Unfiltered” is a modern but accurate paraphrase of the original sense.

**Booty** (noun)  
Mid-15th century, from Old French *butin* (“booty”), derived from Germanic and Middle Low German *bute* (“exchange” or “distribution of plunder”). Historically, it refers to spoils taken in conflict — valuables seized by force. “Spoils of war” is the precise term; “treasure” is a natural figurative extension, given what was typically captured.

In more modern parlance, RawBooty is also what’s left when life kicks you in the ass.

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is simple.

After retiring from hedge fund management, I wanted a place to deposit and share my understanding and perspective on a range of topics — economics, markets, geopolitics, and systems more broadly.

The intent is explanatory, not performative: to lay out *why* things are happening, how incentives and constraints interact, and what the longer-term implications may be.

I aim to remain broadly apolitical, though no promises are made. I am a capitalist by disposition, and much of the analysis is framed through a Darwinian lens: selection, pressure, adaptation, and failure. This is my attempt to document the raw, sometimes uncomfortable logic underlying complex systems, as I see it.

## Publishing approach

Content on RawBooty is intentionally infrequent.

Rather than posting continuously, the goal is to publish when there is something substantive to explain — a concept, a mechanism, or a set of implications that benefit from being laid out coherently and at length.

Short posts on social platforms (e.g., X/Twitter) may reference or point to work hosted here, but this site is the primary archive and canonical source.

## Scope and tone

The writing is:
- analytical rather than partisan  
- opinionated where interpretation is unavoidable, but grounded in economic and financial reasoning  
- focused on mechanisms and consequences rather than advocacy  

Topics may include geopolitics, but content is not intended as political messaging.
